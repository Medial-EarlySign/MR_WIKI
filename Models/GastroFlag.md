# GastroFlag

## Overview

The GastroFlag model was created to identify gastric cancer using data from Maccabi Healthcare Services (MHS), Israelâ€™s second largest HMO.

This model is effective not only in detecting colon and rectal cancer but also performs well in recognizing lower gastrointestinal (GI) disorders and pre-cancerous conditions.

The finalized model has been validated across eight different sites:

* THIN (UK dataset)
* Japan
* Taiwan
* United States
* Latvia
* Korea (2 sites)
* MHS

A publication may be available in the future.

## Model Inputs

## Intended Usage

- **Not for screening exclusion:** This tool is not intended to rule out patients from screening. Its sensitivity is insufficient for use as a primary screening tool.
- **Purpose:** The model is designed to help increase compliance and improve the yield of colonoscopies among patients who are non-adherent to screening recommendations.
- **Professional use only:** The tool is intended for interpretation and use by healthcare professionals, not patients.

The model is designed to calculate a score when new CBC data is available. Requests to calculate a score without CBC data will be rejected. A score can still be generated even if some other input signals are missing.
