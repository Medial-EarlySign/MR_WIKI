# LungFlag

## Overview

The LungFlag model was developed at Kaiser Permanente Southern California (KPSC) to identify all types of lung cancer, including Squamous, Adenocarcinoma, Small Cell, and Non-Small Cell variants.

It has been validated at approximately 10 different sites.

## Model Inputs

Inputs are listed in the `/discovery` API, including signal names and required units.

* Birth year (for age calculation)
* Sex
* Measurements: BMI, Weight, Height
* Smoking Information: Smoking Status (mandatory), Smoking duration (years), smoking intensity (ciggarets per day), Pack years, Smoking quit date (if applicable)
* Diagnosis signal: ICD10/ICD9
* Spirometry test: Fev1
* CBC panel: Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, RBC, MCH, MCV, MCHC, Platelets, RDW, WBC, Lymphocytes (absolute and %), Monocytes (absolute and %), Eosinophils (absolute and %), Basophils (absolute and %), Neutrophils (absolute and %)
* Lipid panel: Cholesterol, Triglycerides, LDL, HDL, NonHDLCholesterol
* Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP): Glucose, Creatinine, Urea
* Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP) additions: Albumin, Protein_Total, ALT, ALKP
