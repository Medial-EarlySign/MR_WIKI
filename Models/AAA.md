# AAA

## Overview

Developed and implemented at Geisinger Health System (Pennsylvania), this model identifies cases of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysm (AAA). Beyond standard criteria, it has been specifically adapted to enhance fairness and to detect AAA in females, even though this is not part of the USPSTF guidelines.

## Deployments

- Geisinger Health System (since 2022)

## Intended Usage

The model is designed to assist in referring patients for ultrasound (US) screening for AAA. While USPSTF guidelines recommend screening for males aged 65 and older who are current or former smokers, Geisinger has broadened the criteria to also include females aged 65 and older with a history of smoking.
