# Medial Tools
## Documentition of Tools:

- [action_outcome_effect](action_outcome_effect): A tool for matching and estimating average treatmnet/action effect on outcome
- [bootstrap_app ](bootstrap_app)- the bootstrap analysis application
- [model_runner ](/Archive/model_runner)- a full tool to build model by pipline of building registry, sampling, filtering, matching, signalDependency, feature selectio, model selection,training and boostrap analysis. with ability to recover from last step / skip steps...
- [SignalsDependencies](SignalsDependencies) - A tool to find statistical dependency between registry and signal value withing time window. used as selector for categorical signals
- [Flow ](Using%20the%20Flow%20App)- Our app to create repository and do a lot of things with our data/model/repository
- [create_registry ](create_registry)- A Tool to create MedRegistry, and if provided sampling startegy - to create MedSamples from it
- [TestModelExternal ](TestModelExternal)- A tool to test difference between repositories when applying a model. It build a propensity model to discriminate between repositories to reveal differences
- [adjust_model ](adjust_model)- an app to change and adjust the model - add rep_processor, post_processor, etc...
